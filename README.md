## ✨ The Problem
We come across so many great things online, across multiple platforms. To hold onto them, we save posts, take screenshots (sometimes even multiples of the same thing), and bookmark links. However, when the time arises, do we recall where specifically we saved a particular thing? Usually, we go down rabbit-holes acorss the multiverse of different platforms. *Enter BrainDump!*

## 😼 The Solution
BrainDump! allows for dump!ing content from different sources, be it article links or funny cat videos you come across on y0utube. 
It automatically detects when you take a screenshot, so you can directly save it in BrainDump!
We provide customization! Users can customize folders, add manual tags to each dump! and edit them, keeping the dump!ster clean.
Find any dump! by globally seaching titles, tags nnd raw text!
Theres also Dark Mode, if that intrigues you 👀
